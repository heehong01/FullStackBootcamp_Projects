## School Management Service



So in the README.md file of your SBA project, the following is what I expect to see:
How you create the tables
How you populate the tables
If you have test code or not
If the test code succeeded or not


    /*main -

-This method displays and prompts the user to select 
one of the following with the  option:



1. Student: This allows the user to enter his/her 
email and password and check whether or not those 
credentials are valid, in order to log in. If the 
credentials are invalid the program should end 
with an appropriate message to the student.



If the credentials are valid, the student is logged in 
and all the classes the Student is registered to should 
be displayed. Displays and prompt the student to select 
one of the following two additional numeric (1 or 2) 
options that are available:

·   1) Register to Class: This displays all
the courses in the database and allows the 
student to select a course in which the student 
wished to be registered. If the Student is already 
registered in that course, display the message 
"You are already registered in that course!", 
otherwise, register the student to that course 
and save this result in your database. Also, 
show the updated registered courses list for that 
student. After that end the program with an 
appropriate message.

·   2) Logout: Which ends the program with an 
appropriate message.



2. quit: which ends the program with an 
3. appropriate message.*/


- Open any existing project that uses either MariaDB or MYSQL and use H2 instead
- Change the test data
- Add additional code to display the contents of the table to verify
